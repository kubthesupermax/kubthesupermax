## Hi there 👋

I’m Franklin Kuba, an AI-native backend engineer based in Canada.

I design and build production-ready systems that combine AI capabilities with reliable, scalable infrastructure.

My work focuses on Python, JavaScript, cloud platforms, containers, and modern AI tooling—building APIs, real-time systems, and intelligent backends that are meant to ship and scale.

I’m especially interested in how AI integrates into real backend workflows: model-driven APIs, automation, observability, and cloud-native deployment.

Most of my projects are end-to-end systems—from architecture and infrastructure to deployment and monitoring.

I value clarity, fundamentals, and building things that actually work.
